# XR-Templates
This repository contains a starter template for creating XR applications using Unity and OpenXR. This project comes with all the necesarry settings and plugins required for an XR Project. It also has premade prefabs that can be used along with locatomotion, Input Mangae and XR Ray Interactor added. OpenXR is an open standard for XR platform interoperability, allowing developers to create a single application that works across multiple XR systems. However we are using Meta Quest 2 as a hardware for testing in this template. <br>

Meta Quest Mixed Reality Features


## Getting Started
Using the following steps you can setup the project on your machine and run it on an XR Device. For this particular project, we’ll be deploying it on a Meta Quest 2.
### Software Setup
* Clone/Download the Project Repository.
* Install Unity Hub for your machine from official [Unity Site](https://unity.com/download).
* Choose Unity Version - 2021.3.1f1 and add “Android Build Support” (You can skip this step as well and do it in next to next step)
* Now, click on open under projects and navigate to the downloaded project repository. Open “OpenXR_Oculus” directory.
Unity might prompt you by saying that you do not have the correct version of Unity. Make sure you download the required version with  “Android Build Support”.
* Now once you are in Unity, from the top bar, navigate to File> Build Settings > Android
* Make sure, under “Scenes in Build”, “Scene/main” is selected,  and click on Switch Platform.
* That’s it, now we need to prepare our headset to run the project.
### Hardware Setup
* Follow the instructions on [Oculus Device Setup Page](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/) to put your device in Developer Mode
### Build App
* Now go back to Unity and under Android Build Settings, click “Refresh” and make sure you can discover your headset in the drop down. If you can’t see it, please complete the previous step.
Select you headset and click “Build and Run”
